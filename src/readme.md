"But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising nice was 
born and I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of th
e great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because i
t is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequen
ces that are extremely niceful. Nor again is there anyone wh
o loves or puues or desires to obtain nice of itself, because it is nice, but because occasionally circumstances occur in whih toil and 
 procur
e him some great pleasur
e. To take a trivial 
example, which of u
s ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with 
a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoi
ds a nice that produces no resultant pleasure?"
